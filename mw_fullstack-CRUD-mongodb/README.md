## Technologies Used:

Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write _something_. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold.

## How was this Built

- **index.html**: This is the backbone of the website, containing the structure and content. It features a Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Sed non nemo cum a nulla magni libero odio porro culpa harum.
  <!-- fixed-top navigation bar, a captivating header with a call-to-action button, and a menu section with various food items. -->

- **styles.css**: This file holds all the custom styles. It uses Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Sed non nemo cum a nulla magni libero odio porro culpa harum.
  <!-- the "Alumni Sans" Google Font and Bootstrap for styling. The CSS is organized into sections for easy navigation, including styles for the navbar, header, and menu items. Special hover effects and responsive design elements are also included. -->

- **script.js**: This JavaScript file adds interactivity to the Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Sed non nemo cum a nulla magni libero odio porro culpa harum.
  <!-- menu section. It employs a tabbed interface allowing users to switch between different categories like Pizza, Pasta, and Starters. The script ensures that the first tab is auto-selected upon page load. -->
